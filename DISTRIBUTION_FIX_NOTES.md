# Distribution Path Fix - Technical Notes

## Problem
The initial distribution app couldn't load CoreML models because of path resolution issues between development and bundled app environments.

## Root Cause
`ofToDataPath(path, true)` with the `absolute` flag set to `true` returns absolute paths that work in development (`/path/to/project/bin/data/`) but break when the app is bundled, as those absolute paths no longer exist.

## Solution (Two-Part Fix)

### 1. Code Changes - Remove Absolute Path Flag
Changed all `ofToDataPath(path, true)` calls to `ofToDataPath(path)` in:
- **DetectionManager.cpp**: Model loading paths (4 changes)
- **ScaleManager.cpp**: Scala directory paths (2 changes)
- **ConfigManager.cpp**: Config file paths (2 changes)
- **UIManager.cpp**: UI display paths (3 changes)

**Why this works**: Without the absolute flag, openFrameworks uses relative paths that adapt to both environments:
- Development: Resolves to `bin/data/`
- Bundled App: Resolves to `MacOS/../../../data/` (relative to executable)

### 2. Distribution Script - Dual Data Placement
Updated `create_distribution.sh` to place data in TWO locations:

```bash
# Primary location: Inside app bundle (standard macOS practice)
cp -R bin/data SonifyV1.app/Contents/Resources/data

# Fallback location: Symlink for relative path resolution
ln -sf SonifyV1.app/Contents/Resources/data distribution/SonifyV1/data
```

**Path resolution in bundled app**:
```
SonifyV1.app/
├── Contents/
│   ├── MacOS/
│   │   └── SonifyV1  (executable looks for ../../../data/)
│   └── Resources/
│       └── data/     (actual data location)
└── [parent folder]/
    └── data/         (symlink → SonifyV1.app/Contents/Resources/data)
```

## Technical Details

### ofToDataPath() Behavior
- `ofToDataPath(path)` or `ofToDataPath(path, false)`: Relative path resolution
  - Development: Returns `bin/data/path`
  - Bundled: Returns `MacOS/../../../data/path` → resolves via symlink to `Resources/data/path`

- `ofToDataPath(path, true)`: Absolute path (AVOID in distributable apps)
  - Development: Returns `/absolute/path/to/project/bin/data/path`
  - Bundled: Returns same absolute path → BREAKS (path doesn't exist)

### Why Both Locations?
1. **Resources/data**: Standard macOS app bundle structure, contains actual files
2. **Symlink at distribution root**: Satisfies openFrameworks' relative path expectations
3. **Result**: Works in both development and distribution, portable across machines

## Verification
```bash
# Test the distributed app
cd distribution/SonifyV1
./SonifyV1.app/Contents/MacOS/SonifyV1 2>&1 | grep "CoreML model loaded"

# Should see:
# [notice ] YOLOv8M CoreML model loaded successfully
```

## Files Modified

### Source Code (Path Resolution)
- `src/DetectionManager.cpp` - Lines 79, 99, 114, 130
- `src/ScaleManager.cpp` - Lines 11, 613
- `src/ConfigManager.cpp` - Lines 195, 209
- `src/UIManager.cpp` - Lines 390, 1338, 1443

### Build Scripts (Distribution)
- `create_distribution.sh` - Lines 50-57 (added symlink creation)

## Best Practices for openFrameworks Distribution

### ✅ DO
- Use `ofToDataPath(path)` without absolute flag
- Bundle data in `Contents/Resources/data/`
- Create symlinks for relative path compatibility
- Test the distribution app separately from development

### ❌ DON'T
- Use `ofToDataPath(path, true)` for files that need to work in distribution
- Rely only on Resources folder (OF expects relative paths from executable)
- Assume development paths will work in bundled apps
- Skip testing the distributed app

## Why This Pattern Works

### Development Environment
```
project/
├── bin/
│   ├── data/           ← ofToDataPath() resolves here
│   └── SonifyV1.app
└── src/
```

### Distribution Environment
```
SonifyV1/
├── SonifyV1.app/
│   └── Contents/
│       ├── MacOS/
│       │   └── SonifyV1    (looks for ../../../data/)
│       └── Resources/
│           └── data/       (actual files)
└── data/                   (symlink to above)
```

The symlink makes `MacOS/../../../data/` resolve to the correct location!

## Impact
- ✅ Standalone app now loads all CoreML models
- ✅ Scala scale files accessible
- ✅ Configuration saves/loads properly
- ✅ Works when moved to any location (Applications folder, Desktop, etc.)
- ✅ No dependencies on development environment paths

## Testing Checklist
- [x] CoreML models load successfully
- [x] Scala scales are found and loaded
- [x] Config file reads/writes work
- [x] UI displays correct paths
- [x] App works from distribution folder
- [x] Symlink resolves correctly
- [x] DMG installer works

## Future Considerations
- For Mac App Store distribution, symlinks in DMG might need to be actual copies
- Code signing might require additional steps for the symlinked data
- Consider fully bundling data inside Resources without symlinks (would require more code changes)
