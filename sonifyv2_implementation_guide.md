# SonifyV2 Linear Implementation Guide
## Step-by-Step Development with AI Agents

**Prerequisites:** ✅ Complete Environment Setup finished and verified

---

## **Development Philosophy**

### **Linear Progression Rule:**
**Never proceed to the next step until the current step works perfectly.** Each task builds a working system that you can see, test, and verify immediately.

### **Success Criteria Format:**
Every task ends with **"You should see:"** - a clear visual or functional proof that the step worked. No abstractions, no "it should work in theory."

### **AI Agent Workflow:**
```bash
# Start each development session
cd ~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/SonifyV2
conda activate sonifyml
code .

# For each task below:
claude "[AI Task from this guide]"
# Implement code
make && ./bin/SonifyV2
# Verify success criteria
# Only proceed when working perfectly
```

## **AI Development Notes**

### **Maintaining Quality with AI Agents:**
- **Always specify success criteria** - AI needs clear targets
- **Test immediately** - Verify each step works before proceeding
- **Request complete implementations** - No partial code or TODO comments
- **Include error handling** - AI should provide robust code
- **Specify platform requirements** - M1 Mac, performance targets, etc.

### **Common AI Prompt Patterns:**
```bash
# For new features
claude "Add [feature] to SonifyV2 with [requirements]. Success criteria: [specific observable results]"

# For debugging  
claude "Fix this SonifyV2 [problem]: [error/symptoms]. Platform: M1 Mac, existing codebase at [location]"

# For optimization
claude "Optimize SonifyV2 [component] for [performance target]. Current issue: [bottleneck description]"
```

### **Development Rhythm:**
1. **Read task requirements carefully**
2. **Ask AI to implement with specific requirements**
3. **Compile and test immediately**
4. **Verify success criteria met**
5. **Debug with AI if needed**
6. **Only proceed when working perfectly**

**This linear approach ensures each development session builds working, demonstrable progress toward a professional creative coding platform.**
